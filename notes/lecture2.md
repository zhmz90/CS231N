# Lecture 2: Image Classification Pipeline

- Problem
  - map between 3D arrays and an integer.

- Challenges
  - Viewpoint Variation
  - Illumination
  - Deformation
  - Occlusion
  - Background clutter
  - Intraclass variation

- Data-driven approach
  - collect a dataset
  - train a classifer with an algorithm
  - eval it on test dataset

- Classifiers
  - Nearest Neighbor Classifier
    - distance metric: L1, L2
    - terrible perfermance at test time
  - Hyperparameter
    - Cross-validation
