# Lecture 4: Backpropagation and Neural Networks part 1

- Computational Graph
  - the chain rule
  - Backpropagation: init, forward, backward

- Layer
  - use efficient vectorized code

- TO CHALLENGE
  - derivative of sigmoid
  - to implement a NN network

- Question
  - reverse-mode and forward-mode differentiation
